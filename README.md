# Puzzle Maze
I am working on a little project with riddles and a bunch of loops. 


For each riddle, there's points:

        1 point for a simple riddle, 
        
        5 points for a bit harder riddle and 
        
        10 point for harder riddles.



The points work in 2 ways, if the answer is correct, the points gets added, if the answer is incorrect, the points get removed.

At the end of the code, each user is able to view their score and save it.
